# Basic Neural Network with a New Dataset

This is a neural network that takes a previously unpublished dataset.

## About the dataset

The dataset is a cvs file that represents the NCAA Women's Gymnastics team scores from 1998 to 2018 in the regular season.
The scores were obtained from the [Road to Nationals](https://roadtonationals.com/results/) web page, and it contains close to 
20,000 entries. Although this dataset only covers the All Around and the regular season, I will be updating it with more entries 
hopefully in the close future. Also, I plan to do another dataset for the men.

## About the Neural Network

The python file is a very basic Neural Network that I used to learn and understand how they work. It should be noted however that 
it does the job.
